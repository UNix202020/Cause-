	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
		<p>We know how to code.</p> 
		<p>We have serious skills, and we want to use them to provide valuable services to small businesses,</p> 
		<p>AND raise money for our friends who are homeless.</p>
	<h2>What do we do?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>We make websites and apps, we engineer software!</li>
			<li>We mentor young people who are interested in learning how to code.</li> 
			<li>We provide laptops to homeless or housing-compromised youth, so they can practice their coding skills and train for new jobs. We are especially interested in giving free or low-cost laptops to young women who want to learn how to code, but don't have computers.</li>
			<li>We create opportunities for real-world work experience, by hiring them to help us on projects for a living wage.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>How does this work?</h2>
		<p>For every $100 we earn, we donate $20 to youth shelters to help provide housing, job training, counseling, and more.</p>
